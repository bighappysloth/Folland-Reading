# Banach Manifold extensions.
Let $E$ and $F$ be Banach spaces and $\lambda$, $\mu$ non-zero elements in the dual of $E$ and $F$ respectively. Define $$E^{+}_{\lambda} = \{x\in E, \lambda x\geq 0\}$$, $$E^{-}_{\lambda}$$, $$E^{0}_{\lambda}$$ respectively. 


A function $$f: U\cap E^{+}_{\lambda}\to V\cap F^{+}_{\mu}$$ is said to be $C^p$ if every $x$ in the domain of $f$, admits an extension in the sense of $U_1\osub E$, $U_2\osub F$,

$$
f_1\in C^p(U_1, U_2)\quad\text{where}\quad f_1\vert_{U\cap E^{+}_{\lambda}} = f.
$$

The derivative in this sense is well defined, because we can take vectors $v\in E \cong E_{\lambda}^{0}\oplus \real\omega$, where $\omega\in E$ is an element such that $\lambda\omega = 1$.

Question: Can we do the same for arbitrary subsets? Can we do the same for arbitrary closed subsets?

Can we preserve the kernel? in such an extension?

# Harmonic extensions of $H_{1/2}$? 
Why can we extend distributions $H_{1/2}(S^1)$ to the disc? Is this possible in higher dimensions?
